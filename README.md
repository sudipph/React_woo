## Woocommerce Notes

In order to avoid problems like :

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://HOST/wp-json/wc/v3/products/categories?per_page=100' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Request header field X-XSRF-TOKEN is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.

```

You should add you the Woocommerce headers this line:

```
header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, x-xsrf-token, x_csrftoken');
```
